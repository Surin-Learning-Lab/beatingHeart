Heartbeat LED Matrix Display
Welcome to the Heartbeat LED Matrix Display project! This project utilizes an Arduino and an 8x8 LED matrix to create a visually appealing display that simulates a beating heart using LEDs. It's perfect for learning about microcontrollers, LED matrix handling, and basic animation techniques.

Features
Animated Heart Patterns: Alternates between a big and small heart to simulate a heartbeat.
Customizable Speed: Adjust the delay in the code to speed up or slow down the animations.
Simple Hardware Setup: Uses basic components ideal for beginners and intermediate users.
Prerequisites
Before you get started, ensure you have the following:

Arduino IDE installed on your computer.
Basic knowledge of Arduino programming.
Necessary hardware components:
Arduino Uno
8x8 LED Matrix
Jumper wires
Breadboard
Appropriate resistors for current limiting
Hardware Setup
Arduino to LED Matrix Connections:

Connect matrix rows to Arduino Digital Pins 2 through 9.
Connect matrix columns to Arduino Digital Pins 10 through 17.
Include current-limiting resistors on each column connection.
Check Connections:

Ensure all connections are secure. Incorrect wiring can lead to short circuits or component damage.
Software Setup
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heartbeat-led-matrix.git
Open and Upload Sketch:

Open the provided Arduino sketch (Heartbeat_LED_Matrix.ino) in the Arduino IDE.
Connect your Arduino via USB.
Select the correct board and port from the Tools menu.
Upload the sketch to your Arduino.
Usage
Once uploaded:

Power the Arduino and observe the LED matrix displaying the heartbeat animation.
Modify the delay() values in the sketch to adjust the animation speed.
